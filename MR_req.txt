This document should be 
concise
explain only the major features of the data 
briefly summarize your plans for creating the prediction algorithm and Shiny app 
understandable to a non-data scientist manager
tables and plots to illustrate summaries

1. Demonstrate that you've downloaded the data and have successfully loaded it in.
2. Create a basic report of summary statistics about the data sets.
3. Report any interesting findings that you amassed so far.
4. Get feedback on your plans for creating a prediction algorithm and Shiny app. 

You DO NOT need to include your actual prediction model 

Keep your report short but descriptive
best not to include actual coding, keep it hidden.
